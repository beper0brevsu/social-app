There are several types of breathing masks available in Fallout 4, each with different stats and appearances. Some of them are based on the ones from previous Fallout games, while others are new additions. Here are some of the most popular breathing masks you can find in Fallout 4:
 
- **FONV Breathing Mask:** This is a mod that adds the iconic breathing mask from Fallout: New Vegas to Fallout 4. It has a sleek black design and offers decent protection against radiation and damage. You can craft it at any chemistry station under the utility category, or find it in various locations around the Commonwealth. You can also customize it with different colors and decals. This mod requires permission from Obsidian Entertainment to use.
- **Cyber Rebreather Mask:** This is another mod that adds a new breathing mask to Fallout 4. It has a futuristic cyberpunk style and offers better protection than standard gas masks. It also has a unique feature that allows you to breathe underwater for a limited time. You can craft it at any armor workbench under the headgear category, or find it in a secret location near Diamond City. This mod does not require any permissions to use.
- **Gas Masks of the Wasteland:** This is a mod that overhauls the whole gas mask system in Fallout 4. It adds a new resource called gas mask filters, which are required to wear gas masks in exterior wasteland areas. If you run out of filters, your gas mask will become useless and you will be exposed to radiation and dust. You can craft filters at any chemistry station under the utility category, or buy them from vendors. This mod also adds several new types of gas masks, some of which have special effects like night vision or thermal vision. This mod requires permission from Metro 2033 developers to use.

As you can see, there are plenty of options for breathing masks in Fallout 4. Whether you want to enhance your survival or your style, you can find a breathing mask that suits your needs. Just remember to keep an eye on your filters and don't let them run out!
  
If you are wondering how to get these breathing masks in Fallout 4, here are some tips and tricks. First of all, you need to install the mods that add them to the game. You can use a mod manager like Nexus Mod Manager or Vortex to easily download and install the mods. Alternatively, you can manually download the mod files and place them in your Fallout 4 data folder.
 
Once you have installed the mods, you can start looking for the breathing masks in the game. Some of them can be crafted at crafting stations, while others can be found in specific locations or looted from enemies. Here are some examples of where to find the breathing masks:

- **FONV Breathing Mask:** You can craft this mask at any chemistry station under the utility category. You need 2 cloth, 2 leather, 2 rubber, and 1 adhesive to make one. You can also find this mask in various locations around the Commonwealth, such as Vault 111, Sanctuary Hills, Concord, Diamond City, and more. You can also loot this mask from some raiders and gunners.
- **Cyber Rebreather Mask:** You can craft this mask at any armor workbench under the headgear category. You need 4 cloth, 4 leather, 4 rubber, 4 steel, and 2 circuitry to make one. You can also find this mask in a secret location near Diamond City. To access it, you need to find a hidden switch behind a dumpster in an alleyway. The switch will open a door that leads to a basement where you can find the mask and some other goodies.
- **Gas Masks of the Wasteland:** You can craft various types of gas masks at any chemistry station under the utility category. You need different materials depending on the type of gas mask you want to make. You can also buy gas masks from vendors like Trashcan Carla or Cricket. Some gas masks can also be found in certain locations or looted from enemies. For example, you can find a military gas mask in Fort Hagen or a raider gas mask in Corvega Assembly Plant.

Now that you have your breathing mask, you can equip it and enjoy its benefits. However, you also need to be aware of its drawbacks. For example, some breathing masks will reduce your perception or charisma while wearing them. Also, if you are using Gas Masks of the Wasteland mod, you need to monitor your filter level and replace it when it runs out. Otherwise, your gas mask will become ineffective and you will be exposed to radiation and dust.
 
Breathing masks are a useful and cool addition to Fallout 4. They can help you survive the harsh environment of the wasteland and give you a unique look. Whether you prefer a classic Fallout style or a futuristic cyberpunk style, you can find a breathing mask that matches your taste. Just remember to keep your filters fresh and your mask clean!
