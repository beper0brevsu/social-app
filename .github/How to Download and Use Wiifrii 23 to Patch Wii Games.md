To select your Wii ISO file, you can either drag and drop it onto the Wiifrii window, or click on the Browse button and navigate to the folder where your ISO file is located. Once you select your ISO file, you should see its name and size on the top of the window.
 
## Step 4: Choose Your Patching Options
 
Now you can choose how you want to patch your Wii game using the four tabs on the Wiifrii window. Here is a brief explanation of what each tab does:
 
- Patching Options: This tab allows you to remove updates and region locks from your Wii game. You can also change the game ID and name if you want.
- Region Options: This tab allows you to change the region of your Wii game. You can choose from NTSC-U (USA), NTSC-J (Japan), PAL (Europe), or AUTO (detects the region automatically).
- Video Options: This tab allows you to change the video mode of your Wii game. You can choose from NTSC (60Hz), PAL (50Hz), PAL60 (60Hz), or AUTO (detects the video mode automatically). You can also force a 480p resolution on games that do not support it by default.
- Other Options: This tab allows you to enable or disable some extra features, such as brick protection, error 002 fix, anti-piracy fix, and IOS reload block.

You can use the default settings or customize them according to your preferences. For example, if you want to convert a NTSC game to PAL, you can select PAL in the Region Options tab and PAL60 in the Video Options tab.
 
## Step 5: Patch Your Wii ISO File
 
Once you have chosen your patching options, click on the Patch button at the bottom of the window. Wiifrii will start patching your Wii ISO file and show you a progress bar. Depending on the size of your ISO file and your PC speed, this may take some time.
 
When the patching process is done, you should see a message saying "Patching Complete!". You can then close Wiifrii and find your patched ISO file in the same folder as your original ISO file. The patched ISO file will have a "\_wiifriied" suffix in its name.
