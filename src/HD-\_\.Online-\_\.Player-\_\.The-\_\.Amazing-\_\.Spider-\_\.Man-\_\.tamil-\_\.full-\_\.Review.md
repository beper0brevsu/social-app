The Amazing Spider-Man is the first installment of a planned trilogy that was supposed to continue with The Amazing Spider-Man 2 in 2014 and The Amazing Spider-Man 3 in 2016. However, due to the disappointing box office performance and critical reception of the second movie, the third movie was cancelled and the franchise was rebooted again with Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017, which is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 
The Amazing Spider-Man also features several Easter eggs and references to the wider Spider-Man lore and comics. For example, the movie introduces Dr. Rajit Ratha, a character who works for Oscorp and is involved in the creation of Venom, a symbiotic alien that bonds with Spider-Man's suit and later with Eddie Brock, a rival reporter. The movie also hints at the existence of Norman Osborn, the founder of Oscorp and the alter ego of the Green Goblin, one of Spider-Man's archenemies.
 
The Amazing Spider-Man was nominated for several awards, including two Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Editing. It also won a Teen Choice Award for Choice Summer Movie: Action and a People's Choice Award for Favorite Movie Fan Following. The movie has a rating of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic.
